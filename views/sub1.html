								Server and Client Technologies
							</h1>

							<h3>
								Client Technologies
							</h3>
							<p>
								Front end technologies, or "client technologies", are tools and techniques that reside on the machine that are in control of the end-user. For example, right now you are using a computer to view this website, and as the end-user you are using the filsystem of the operating system to view this file locally instead of over internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								In regards to utilizing these methods during web development, We can go down to the fundamentals which are defined as Hypertext Markup Languages, JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets. These technologies, namely JavaScript as the outlining progrmaming language, are what a web developer will utilize to formalize a framework, build and improve upon to create the end product; a website.
							</p>
							<p>
								Other front end technologies could include, but are not limited to; Frameworks that wrap the above described languages, Integrated Development Environments, Chrome DevTools (do Ctrl+Shift+i to view this websites' DevTools).
							</p>
							<h4>
								Relation to Presentation Layer of the OSI Model
							</h4>
							<p>
								All the above statements can be related to the presentation layer of the OSI model; Formalized to represent the telecommunications of a computer system with regards to its underlying features and functions. Said presentation layer is utlizied to parse the syntax that the developer is typing into the IDE and turning it into an output in the browser that the user can then view. This process works vice-versa.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Server Technologies
							</h3>
							<p>
								Back end technologies or "server technologoies", are tools and techniques that reside on the machine that is actively hosting the resource that you (the end-user) is requesting. If you are viewing this webpage, there are no active back end technologies because the files are static and locally configured, so there is no need for a server to host these files. For example, lets go to www.youtube.com, this website has countless back end technologies that are hosting the website files and other resources such as videos. These videos will only be sent back to the user based on a request for video resources.

								Conclusion
							</h2>
							<p>
								Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
